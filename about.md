Hello! You've reached my homepage. I'm a software engineer at Facebook in Seattle. In the past, I've interned at Google and Amazon as well. I'm interested in machine learning, neuroscience, and traveling, and I love to <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">hear from people</a> about new things in the world and potential collaborations!. I split this blog between machine learning posts (relating to whatever I happen to be working on) and personal posts (which are about a number of things, mostly traveling). Hope you enjoy!
