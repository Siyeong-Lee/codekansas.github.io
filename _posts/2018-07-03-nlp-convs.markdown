# Introduction

Deep learning has been applied widely in natural language processing <sup><a href="#">[citation needed]</a></sup>. In this post I hope to apply some of the intuition for convolutional neural networks from the object recognition world to the NLP world, using a simple classification problem (sentiment analysis) as our testbed. Hopefully, after reading through it, you'll have a better understanding of how to design neural networks for NLP tasks that are easier to interpret and debug, and hopefully get better results on practical NLP tasks. I personally really believe in having interactive visualizations as well, so this won't just be a dry, explanatory blog post.
