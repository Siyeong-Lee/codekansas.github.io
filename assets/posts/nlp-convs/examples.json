  "this film requires a lot of patience because it focuses on mood and character development the plot is very simple and many of the scenes take place on the same set in frances austen's the sandy dennis character apartment but the film builds to a disturbing climax the characters create an atmosphere rife with sexual tension and psychological trickery it's very interesting that robert altman directed this considering the style and structure of his other films still the trademark altman audio style is evident here and there i think what really makes this film work is the brilliant performance by sandy dennis it's definitely one of her darker characters but she plays it so perfectly and convincingly that it's scary michael burns does a good job as the mute young man regular altman player michael murphy has a small part the moody set fits the content of the story very well in short this movie is a powerful study of loneliness sexual repression and desperation be patient up the atmosphere and pay attention to the wonderfully written script i praise robert altman this is one of his many films that deals with unconventional fascinating subject matter this film is disturbing but it's sincere and it's sure to elicit a strong emotional response from the viewer if you want to see an unusual film some might even say bizarre this is worth the time unfortunately it's very difficult to find in video stores you may have to buy it off the internet",
  "i generally love this type of movie however this time i found myself wanting to kick the screen since i can't do that i will just complain about it this was absolutely idiotic the things that happen with the dead kids are very cool but the alive people are absolute idiots i am a grown man pretty big and i can defend myself well however i would not do half the stuff the little girl does in this movie also the mother in this movie is reckless with her children to the point of neglect i wish i wasn't so angry about her and her actions because i would have otherwise enjoyed the flick what a number she was take my advise and fast forward through everything you see her do until the end also is anyone else getting sick of watching movies that are filmed so dark anymore one can hardly see what is being filmed as an audience we are impossibly involved with the actions on the screen so then why the hell can't we have night vision",
  "i'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold all who love this movie should email disney and increase the demand for it they'd eventually have to sell it then i'd buy copies for everybody i know everything and everybody in this movie did a good job and i haven't figured out why disney hasn't put this movie on dvd or on vhs in rental stores at least i haven't seen any copies this is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all the kids in the new generation don't get to see it and i think they should it should at least be put back on the channel this movie doesn't deserve a cheap download it deserves the real thing i'm them now this movie will be on dvd"
